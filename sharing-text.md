## Text for sharing

We'd love to have folks share the project for discussion and feedback! Here's some language you can use if you want to share about this
effort in an email or general communications.

### To an individual you think would be interested

Hi PERSON,

I know you've been interested in (open source sustainability / the infrastructure to support open source projects / fiscal sponsorship 
of open source). I've really appreciated your perspective and experience on this topic. I thought you might be interested in this project
that's collecting and synthesizing ideas on what open source projects need from sponsoring organzations. 

I'm excited about these ideas coming together, and I think your experience / perspective with YYY would be really great to have included.

I'm excited about these ideas coming together, and I thought it was something you might want to share with your community for ideas 
or feedback.

DRAFT - Needs work 

What operational support does your open source project need to make your life easier, so you can focus on the project and not the paperwork?

Neil Chue Hong, Tracy Teal and Carol Willing are doing a community consultation to understand what services are needed from supporting organizations. This will become a reference for projects 
when thinking about their operational needs at different stages, and as guidance for supporting organization to identify the services 
they can provide. A project-led perspective on these needs will help open source projects and sponsoring organizations
have a shared approach to identifying and understanding needs and for sponsoring organziations to know what to provide, so each project
and organization doesn't need to navigate these things on their own.

We want to hear from all types of people and projects! Join the [discussion](https://github.com/managing-os-projects/os-fiscal-sponsor-needs/discussions) or share comments in an [anonymous survey](https://forms.gle/tCc8HBDPXEmvMwve9), and contribute to the [conversation](https://github.com/managing-os-projects/os-sponsor-needs/blob/main/contributing.md).
