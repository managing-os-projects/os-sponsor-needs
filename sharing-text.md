## Text for sharing

We'd love to have folks share the project for discussion and feedback! Here's some language you can use if you want to share about this
effort in an email or general communications.

### To an individual you think would be interested

Hi PERSON,

I know you've been interested in (open source sustainability / the infrastructure to support open source projects / fiscal sponsorship 
of open source). I've really appreciated your perspective and experience on this topic. I thought you might be interested in this project
that's collecting and synthesizing ideas on what open source projects need from sponsoring organzations. 

I'm excited about these ideas coming together, and I think your experience / perspective with YYY would be really great to have included.

I'm excited about these ideas coming together, and I thought it was something you might want to share with your community for ideas 
or feedback. 


### In a newsletter or announcement

DRAFT - Needs work 

As the open source space continues to evolve, we have the opportunity to bring together ideas on what types of support projects need
from sponsoring organizations. A project-led perspective on these needs would help open source projects and sponsoring organizations
have a shared approach to identifying and understanding needs and for sponsoring organziations to know what to provide, so each project
and organization doesn't need to navigate these things on their own. Neil Chue Hong, Carol Willing and Tracy Teal drafted a set of ideas 
to start a project-led list of sponsoring project needs. This is an opportunity to bring together ideas across different projects. Please
contribute your thoughts and ideas to the dicussion, or list, or fill out the anonymous survey.
